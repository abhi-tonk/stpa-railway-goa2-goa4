![License: CC BY-NC 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--NC%204.0-lightgrey.svg)

This repository includes STPA-based Hierarchical Safety Control Structures (HSCS) developed using the STPA Viewpoint plugin for Capella 7.0.0. It contains projects for Grade of Automation (GoA) levels 2 and 4.

## üìÅ Contents

- `GoA2-HSCS.zip`: Capella project with GoA2-level HSCS  
- `GoA4-HSCS.zip`: Capella project with GoA4-level HSCS  
- `images/`: JPEG snapshots of the control structures

---

## üîß Requirements

- **Capella Version**: 7.0.0
- **STPA Viewpoint Plugin**: [STPA Viewpoint for Capella](https://github.com/labs4capella/stpa-capella)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Notes

1. Install the **STPA Viewpoint plugin** before opening the projects.
2. Import **only one project at a time** into Capella.
3. **Do not open both GoA2 and GoA4 at the same time**, due to Capella model ID (MMID) conflicts.
4. After importing a project, open:  
   `ST.aird ‚Üí STPA Analysis ‚Üí Control Structure ‚Üí [GOA2-HSCS or GOA4-HSCS]`
5. To switch between GoA2 and GoA4:
   - Close and delete the current project from the Capella workspace.
   - Import the other from a copy stored outside the workspace.
6. üõë **Keep backups** of your modified versions in a separate folder not indexed by Capella to prevent accidental corruption or loss.

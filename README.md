# STPA Control Structures for GoA2 and GoA4 (Capella 7.0.0)

This repository includes STPA-based Hierarchical Safety Control Structures (HSCS) developed using the STPA Viewpoint plugin for Capella 7.0.0. It contains projects for Grade of Automation (GoA) levels 2 and 4.

## üìÅ Contents

- `GoA2-HSCS.zip`: Capella project with GoA2-level HSCS  
- `GoA4-HSCS.zip`: Capella project with GoA4-level HSCS  
- `images/`: JPEG snapshots of the control structures

---

## üîß Requirements

- **Capella Version**: 7.0.0
- **STPA Viewpoint Plugin**: [STPA Viewpoint for Capella](https://github.com/labs4capella/stpa-capella)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Notes

1. Install the **STPA Viewpoint plugin** before opening the projects.
2. Import **only one project at a time** into Capella.
3. **Do not open both GoA2 and GoA4 at the same time**, due to Capella model ID (MMID) conflicts.
4. After importing a project, open:
ST.aird ‚Üí STPA Analysis ‚Üí Control Structure ‚Üí [GOA2-HSCS or GOA4-HSCS]

5. To switch between GoA2 and GoA4:
- Close and delete the current project from the Capella workspace.
- Import the other from a copy stored outside the workspace.

6. üõë **Keep backups** of your modified versions in a separate folder not indexed by Capella to prevent accidental corruption or loss.

## ü§ù Collaboration

Contributions and collaborations are welcome!

These HSCS models are a starting point ‚Äî they can be further **refined, detailed, or extended to subsystem levels**. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to fork the repository, open issues, or submit pull requests.

Whether you're improving the models, adapting them to another domain, or adding detail ‚Äî your input is valuable.
